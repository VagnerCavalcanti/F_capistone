-What are Base means?
 This dataset has only a for-hire vehicle (FHV). Which means that does not have a table where
the driver has their own car. So Base is the company that rents the car for a Uber (or other 
companies) driver.

-What are Firstclass and Highclass means?
Not sure exactly what is that. It does not seem economic and lux. It looks more 2 different 
companies with luxury cars.

-Comper Lyft, Prestige, Skyline,Uber....10 company!

-How is the traffic of Uber and other in NY?

-Probability of a pickup Firstclass and Highclass by location?

Not for Uber.
"As of April 1, 2019, we are not accepting new for-hire vehicle driver sign-ups in New York City,
 due in part to new TLC regulations.
Create an account to join the waitlist to drive with Uber in NYC, and consider other ways to earn
 with Uber, like delivering with Uber Eats or driving with Uber outside of the five boroughs."
